### 1.5.0 (4 December 2023)

  environment is development (instead of not production, this may cause issues
  for +canary+ or +stage+ Rails environments)

* Added the missing +Karafka::Testing::RSpec::Helpers+ include to the
  RSpec configuration

### 1.0.0 (11 March 2020)

* Dropped support for Ruby 2.3/2.4 and added support for Rails 6.0 ([#6](https://github.com/hausgold/rimless/pull/6))
* Implemented a simple opinionated Kafka consumer setup ([#7](https://github.com/hausgold/rimless/pull/7))

### 0.3.0 (8 November 2019)

* Upgraded the avro_turf gem (`~> 0.11.0`) ([#5](https://github.com/hausgold/rimless/pull/5))

### 0.2.1 (13 August 2019)

* Added support for the
  [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) gem and
  reconfigure the compiled schema directory to be unique per running test
  thread.  This fixes all race conditions which slow down or break user test
  suites.

### 0.2.0 (5 June 2019)

* Added the `Rimless.encode` (`.avro_encode`) and `Rimless.decode`
  (`.avro_decode`) helpers/shortcuts to simplify the interaction with the
  Apache Avro library
  * The `.encode` method automatically performs input data sanitation and
    supports deep relative (to the local namespace) schema resolution. This
    allows you to access deeply located schemes relative by just providing a
    leading period (eg. `.deep.a.b.c` becomes
    `development.your_app.deep.a.b.c`)
* The `.message`, '.sync_message', '.async_message' helpers now make use of the
  new `.encode` functionality which adds transparent data sanitation and schema
  name features
* At the `test` environment the compiled Avro schemas output path is not
  deleted anymore, instead the compiled schemas are overwritten. This may keep
  dead schemas, but it allows parallel test execution without flaws. The removal
  of the compiled schema directory caused previously file read errors when a
  parallel process started a recompilation.

### 0.1.4 (17 April 2019)

* Reconfigure (reset) the AvroTurf instance on tests to avoid caching issues
  (on failed tests the message decoding was not working which results in
  unrelated errors, instead of showing the actual test failure)

### 0.1.3 (16 April 2019)

* Check for unset and empty values while configuring dependencies

### 0.1.2 (16 April 2019)

* Skip the configuration of the AvroTurf gem in case no schema registry URL is
  configured, this allows the smooth run of Rails asset precompilations without
  full environment configurations (eg. on CI)

### 0.1.1 (16 April 2019)

* Skip the configuration of the WaterDrop gem in case no brokers are
  configured, this allows the smooth run of Rails asset precompilations without
  full environment configurations (eg. on CI)

### 0.1.0 (16 April 2019)

* The first release with support for simple Apache Avro message producing on
  Apache Kafka/Confluent Schema Registry
* Improved the automatic Avro Schema ERB template compiling and included a JSON
  validation for each file
* Added a powerful RSpec helper/matcher to ease message producer logic tests
* Added an extensive documentation
